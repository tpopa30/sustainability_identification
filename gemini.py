 "text": "I am asking myself the exact same question at the moment.I am leaning towards the multi-instance single tenancy solution but have not taken a definitive decision yet. Let me share some of my thoughts : The main historical advantage of the multi-tenant architecture is a better use of infrastructure resources, by mutualisation (single OS, single Database, single application layer) and better occupying of said resources (when one user is away another can use the same resource). It also greatly simplifies software lifecycle : you deploy new versions to you one instance, all the customers are updated at the same time. It seems however, that recent advancements in cloud technology make the first class of advantages largely available in a multi-instance (instance-per-customer) architecture (I am thinking specifically of a platform like Jelastic here but I am sure there are others that provide the same features):\n\n • Container-based PaaS\n\n • Provisioning and auto-scaling of containers (elastic containers) \n\n So hardware and platform management is not the Software provider's concern any more. Resources are mutualised much more efficiently than before at the infrastructure and plaform levels. \n\n There will still be an overhead for multi-instance (some app and middleware will be ran N times instead of just one), but much lower than when using a separate (virtual) machine per instance. The database could be shared anyway (one schema per instance, several schemas per DB server)\nAlso :\n\n• Automation of creation of new instances is possible via PaaS API\n\n• Automation of deployment of new versions is possible via PaaS API, with zero downtime (takes some work to put in place)\n\n• Scaling is always out, never up. We don't have to worry about huge datasets at the instance level.\n\n Of course, we would need some kind of central service that manages all this automatically (e.g. creation of instance when a new user creates an account). This would also manage payment and licensing issues, interaction between instances etc. This central service might be quite complex and hard to develop, but the good thing is that we don't have to implement it upfront (now that we don't have much resource) whereas multi-tenant would need to be baked into the app from the start.\n\n Which brings me to the final advantages of developing single-tenant for a very early stage (pre-invesment) startup project :\n\n• Same (or almost same) version of the app can be deployed on-premises either as a virtual appliance or docker container or even on customer-managed machine (some companies are still reluctant towards the Cloud and it may help an early stage startup to not push out important early adopters)\n\n • Faster to get a product out with limited resources (the application layer and database schema is quite less complex), can get a 'dumb' single instance single tenant product out first (MVP) for early adopters and to show the business value of the app to potential investors, and add all the cloud automation later on \n\n• Can be seen as a selling argument for customers worried about data security : the data is better encapsulated since every customer has his own schema or even database. Much less risk of 'spillage'\n\nNB: I am obviously thinking here of a business app where customers would be businesses (each with multiple individual users) and not individuals.

 },
 {
 "label": "cloud services",
 "definition": "Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models.\n Essential Characteristics:\nOn-demand self-service. A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.\n Broad network access. Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).\n Resource pooling. The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. There is a sense of location independence in that the customer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction (e.g., country, state, or datacenter). Examples of resources include storage, processing, memory, and network bandwidth.\n Rapid elasticity. Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.\n Measured service. Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability1 at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service."
 },
 {
 "label": "robotics",
 "definition": "Robotics is the interdisciplinary study and practice of the design, construction, operation, and use of robots.\n Within mechanical engineering, robotics is the design and construction of the physical structures of robots, while in computer science, robotics focuses on robotic automation algorithms. Other disciplines contributing to robotics include electrical, control, software, information, electronic, telecommunication, computer, mechatronic, and materials engineering.\n The goal of most robotics is to design machines that can help and assist humans. Many robots are built to do jobs that are hazardous to people, such as finding survivors in unstable ruins, and exploring space, mines and shipwrecks. Others replace people in jobs that are boring, repetitive, or unpleasant, such as cleaning, monitoring, transporting, and assembling. Today, robotics is a rapidly growing field, as technological advances continue; researching, designing, and building new robots serve various practical purposes."
 },
 {
 "label": "embedded systems",
 "definition": "An embedded system is a microprocessor-based system that is built to control a function or range of functions and is not designed to be programmed by the end user in the same way that a PC is. Yes, a user can make choices concerning functionality but cannot change the functionality of the system by adding/replac- ing software. With a PC, this is exactly what a user can do: one minute the PC is a word processor and the next it's a games machine simply by changing the software. An embedded system is designed to perform one particular task albeit with choices and different options. The last point is important because it differenti- ates itself from the world of the PC where the end user does reprogram it whenever a different software package is bought and run. However, PCs have provided an easily accessible source of hardware and software for embedded systems and it should be no surprise that they form the basis of many embedded systems. To reflect this, a very detailed design example is included at the end of this book that uses a PC in this way to build a sophisticated data logging system for a race car."
 },
 {
 "label": "computer graphics",
 "definition": "The field of computer graphics is a broad and diverse field that exists cross section between computer science and design. It is interested in the entire process of creating computer generated imagery, from creating digital three-dimensional models, to the process of texturing, rendering, and lighting those models, to the digital display of those renderings on a screen. This process starts with simple object rendering techniques to transform mathematical representations of three-dimensional objects into a two-dimensional screen image, calculating projection transformations of vertices as well as occlusion and depth of objects. Detail and realism is added to these images through simulation of materials, textures, and lighting. The most accurate and realistic techniques involve understanding the way light interacts with objects in the physical world, and simulating those interactions as closely as possible on a computer. Phenomena such as reflections, transparencies, or diffuse lighting can be modeled using a variety of different algorithms, some designed to be physically accurate, others to be computationally efficient, depending on different needs. Virtual reality imagery must be generated in a matter of milliseconds, while a detailed architectural rendering may take hours of computation time."
 },
 {
 "label": "hardware architecture",
 "definition": "Computer architecture is the organisation of the components which make up a computer system and the meaning of the operations which guide its function. It defines what is seen on the machine interface, which is targeted by programming languages and their compilers.\n There are three categories of computer architecture, and all work together to make a machine function.\n System design\nSystem design includes all hardware parts of a computer, including data processors, multiprocessors, memory controllers, and direct memory access. It also includes the graphics processing unit (GPU). This part is the physical computer system.\n \n Instruction set architecture (ISA)\n This includes the functions and capabilities of the central processing unit (CPU). It is the embedded programming language and defines what programming it can perform or process. This part is the software that makes the computer run, such as operating systems like Windows on a PC or iOS on an Apple iPhone, and includes data formats and the programmed instruction set.\n \n Microarchitecture\n Microarchitecture is also known as computer organisation and defines the data processing and storage element and how they should be implemented into the ISA. It is the hardware implementation of how an ISA is implemented in a particular processor."
