        "justification": "The text discusses various technical approaches to achieving high availability and load balancing in IT infrastructure, such as Windows Failover Clustering, Network Load Balancing, DNS Round Robin, and hardware load balancers. It focuses on the technical and administrative challenges, costs, and trade-offs associated with these solutions. However, it does not address software sustainability, which typically involves considerations like long-term maintenance, environmental impact, resource efficiency, or sustainable development practices. Therefore, the text is unrelated to software sustainability."
