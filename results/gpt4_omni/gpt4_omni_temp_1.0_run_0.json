        "justification": "The text discusses transitioning from a monolithic architecture to microservices architecture, which is inherently related to software sustainability. By breaking up monolithic systems into microservices, the software becomes more scalable, maintainable, and adaptable, promoting long-term sustainability. The text also includes considerations for infrastructure, testing, deployment, and monitoring strategies, all of which are crucial for sustaining, managing, and evolving software systems effectively."

        "justification": "The text is related to software sustainability as it discusses designing a scalable solution for processing notifications through Azure Services. It highlights the importance of creating a system that can handle increases in load by adding more resources (consumers and queues) without major changes in the codebase. The discussion on evaluating Azure Functions for potentially better integration also shows consideration for sustainable software practices by exploring the most effective and efficient solutions."
