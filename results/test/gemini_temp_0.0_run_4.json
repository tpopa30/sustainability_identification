It covers decisions on sending credentials over HTTPS, methods for preventing unauthorized access (API management, rate limiting), strategies for handling programmatic logins, and best practices for storing sensitive data like refresh tokens (hashing, client-side storage). These are all concrete examples of design decisions made during the development process to ensure security."

These choices are fundamental design decisions. Additionally, the text explicitly addresses cloud adoption, mentioning AWS and comparing on-premise solutions with cloud capabilities, thus relating to cloud services."

This evaluation of different approaches, considering trade-offs like cost, manageability, and technical limitations (persistent storage on Fargate), clearly falls under 'design decision'. Furthermore, the entire discussion is framed within the context of cloud platforms and services (AWS, RDS, Fargate, ECS), making 'cloud services' a relevant label."
