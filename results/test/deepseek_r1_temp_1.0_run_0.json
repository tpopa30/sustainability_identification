While it addresses system performance and architectural decisions, it does not explicitly mention environmental impact, energy efficiency, or long-term maintenance practices central to software sustainability. The focus is on technical efficiency and scalability rather than ecological or societal sustainability concerns."

This aligns with software sustainability goals, as merging redundant systems can reduce energy consumption, hardware waste, and maintenance overhead. The proposed hybrid architecture (local/cloud deployment) also reflects sustainable design principles by prioritizing flexibility, resource efficiency, and long-term maintainability."
