This directly relates to several sustainability dimensions: \n1. **Technical Sustainability:** The discussion revolves around the ability of systems to evolve independently, maintainability (porting legacy code), avoiding brittleness, deployment independence, and the suitability of technology choices for different domains. Forcing a single stack can hinder appropriate evolution and increase technical debt.\n2. **Economic Sustainability:** The author explicitly mentions economic factors like Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) differences (licensing costs, cloud costs for Linux vs. the vendor stack), Return on Investment (ROI) for porting legacy code, training effort, and talent availability, all of which impact the long-term financial viability of the software and the organization."
