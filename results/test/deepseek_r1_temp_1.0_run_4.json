        "justification": "The text discusses architectural choices and trade-offs in cloud-based microservices, specifically focusing on whether to deploy dedicated caches per POD. It emphasizes avoiding premature optimization, sizing solutions based on proven metrics, and balancing complexity with purpose. These considerations directly relate to evaluating and justifying design decisions in system architecture, making 'design decision' the most fitting label. While 'cloud services' is tangentially relevant, the core focus is on the reasoning process behind architectural choices rather than cloud infrastructure itself."
