The focus is on data access control and privacy measures, not on the long-term sustainability of the software system itself."

        "justification": "The text primarily discusses the comparison between Amazon DynamoDB and relational databases, focusing on scalability, management, performance, and reliability aspects of database systems. While it touches on technical considerations that could indirectly relate to technical sustainability (a dimension of software sustainability), the core discussion is not about ensuring the long-term use, evolution, or ecological impact of software-intensive systems. Therefore, it does not directly address the dimensions of software sustainability as defined in the Helper-Data."

        "justification": "The text discusses the interaction between serverless architectures (e.g., AWS Lambda) and databases, focusing on aspects like ownership, scaling, and security. These topics are relevant to technical sustainability, which is concerned with the long-term use and evolution of software-intensive systems in changing environments. The discussion on ensuring clear ownership and managing changes without affecting multiple components aligns with the technical dimension of sustainability, aiming for systems that are maintainable and scalable over time."
