While these strategies can contribute to the technical sustainability of software-intensive systems by addressing long-term use and evolution in changing environments, the text does not explicitly mention or focus on sustainability dimensions such as social, environmental, or economic sustainability. Therefore, it is not directly related to the broader concept of software sustainability as defined in the Helper-Data."

However, it does not address any of the dimensions of software sustainability as defined in the Helper-Data, such as social, environmental, technical, or economic sustainability. The discussion is more about architectural decisions and cloud services rather than sustainability in software-intensive systems."
