        "justification": "The text discusses re-architecting a monolithic application into a microservices architecture to handle scaling requirements more effectively, which relates to Technical sustainability as defined in the Helper-Data. Technical sustainability addresses the long-term use and appropriate evolution of software-intensive systems in changing environments, which includes considerations like system maintenance, obsolescence, and scalability. The discussion on optimizing resource allocation and auto-scaling based on load directly pertains to ensuring the system's longevity and efficiency, key aspects of technical sustainability in software-intensive systems."

        "justification": "The text discusses technical strategies to protect software applications from reverse engineering and unauthorized access, which aligns with the Technical sustainability dimension of software-intensive systems. It emphasizes the importance of evolving software in a changing environment to maintain its long-term use and security, a key aspect of technical sustainability."

        "justification": "The text discusses the architecture of a monolithic application and its potential division into microservices for scaling purposes, as well as considerations about network latency and the use of cloud services for auto-scaling. However, it does not address any of the dimensions of software sustainability (social, environmental, technical, or economic) as defined in the Helper-Data. The discussion is focused on technical architecture and cloud computing efficiencies rather than sustainability in software systems."
