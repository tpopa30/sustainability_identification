The consideration of network latency, resource allocation, and auto-scaling mechanisms are all aspects of ensuring the system's longevity and adaptability, which are key components of technical sustainability in software systems."

While it touches on technical sustainability by mentioning the evolution and protection of software, the primary focus is on security and legal protection rather than the broader dimensions of software sustainability (social, environmental, technical, and economic) as defined in the Helper-Data."

It addresses the long-term use and appropriate evolution of software in changing environments, a key aspect of technical sustainability. Additionally, the mention of auto-scaling and efficient resource management touches on Economic sustainability by preserving financial value through optimized resource use."
