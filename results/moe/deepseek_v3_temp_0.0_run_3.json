        "justification": "The text discusses re-architecting a monolithic application into a microservices architecture to handle scaling requirements more effectively, which relates to technical sustainability. Technical sustainability involves the long-term use and evolution of software-intensive systems in changing environments, as mentioned in the Helper-Data. The consideration of network latency, resource allocation, and auto-scaling are all aspects of ensuring the system can evolve and maintain performance over time, aligning with the definition of technical sustainability in software-intensive systems."

        "justification": "The text discusses technical and legal aspects of protecting an app from reverse engineering and unauthorized access, including the use of DRM, code obfuscation, encryption, and moving critical behavior to cloud services. While it touches on technical sustainability by mentioning the evolution of app architecture (service-oriented architecture), the primary focus is on security and protection mechanisms rather than the broader dimensions of software sustainability such as social, environmental, or economic sustainability."
